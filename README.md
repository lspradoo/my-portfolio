## About the Project

This is my personal portfolio, built to showcase not only my engineering projects (Chrome extensions, high-performance corporate websites) but also my business-oriented mindset (Marketing DNA). 

The main differentiator of this project is the conscious architectural choice to use **Vanilla JavaScript, Semantic HTML5, and Pure CSS3**. In an ecosystem obsessed with shipping 2MB React bundles for simple static landing pages, this portfolio proves a point: by mastering the core technologies, you can deliver a blazing-fast, highly accessible, multilingual, and scalable application. 

The result? **90+ Performance and 100/100 Accessibility & SEO on Google Lighthouse.**

## Featured Solutions

Here are the main products highlighted in this portfolio:

* **B2B Websites:** SEO-optimized corporate platforms focusing on UI/UX, brand authority, and lead generation (e.g., *Innovative Business*, *Oliveira & Sales*).
* **Browser Extensions:**
  * **Câmbio Real-Time:** Quick and precise access to global currency rates directly from the browser without impacting performance.
  * **SmartCase Pro:** The ultimate developer tool for text formatting (camelCase, snake_case), data cleaning, and instantly redacting sensitive information.
  * **ClipOctaplus:** A privacy first clipboard manager that seamlessly saves copy history 100% locally, featuring a PIN-protected secure vault.

## Technical Highlights & "Under the Hood"

* **Zero-Dependency i18n Engine:** Developed a custom Vanilla JS dictionary system that instantly translates the site into 4 languages (PT, EN, ES, PL) via DOM manipulation. No external libraries, no parsing overhead, zero layout shifts.
* **Smart Language Routing:** The script intercepts the `navigator.language` API, identifies the user's OS native language, and serves the correct version instantly, with a seamless fallback to English for unsupported regions.
* **Performance Obsession:** Extensive use of modern CSS features like `content-visibility: auto` for lazy rendering of off-screen sections, keeping the initial paint ridiculously fast.
* **A11y & SEO (The 100/100 Formula):** Perfect semantic structure (`<main>`, `<article>`), dynamic `aria-labels`, `focus-visible` states for keyboard navigation, `prefers-reduced-motion` media queries, and injected JSON-LD Schema.org to feed Google's Knowledge Graph.
* **Custom Domain & DNS:** Successfully deployed via GitHub Pages and routed through a custom domain (`lucasprado.space`), demonstrating practical knowledge of DNS configuration (CNAME/A records).
* **Integrated Gamification:** Implementation of a custom iframe mini-game ("Corgi Break"), utilizing marketing concepts to aggressively increase user dwell time (reducing bounce rate).

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** Pure, semantic, and blind-friendly.
* **CSS3:** Flexbox, CSS Grid, Custom Properties (CSS Variables for the Cyberpunk theme). *Zero Tailwind, Zero Bootstrap.*
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** Vanilla DOM manipulation and logic. *Zero React/Vue.*
* **Infrastructure:** GitHub Pages, DNS Routing.
